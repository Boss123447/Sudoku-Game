My visualization looks at the role of latitude in determining the levels of sunshine in different U.S. cities throughout the different seasons of the year. It aims to help the audience understand the role of distance, in terms of latitude, in determining the levels of sunshine in cities that are south compared to cities that are north and whether this varies over the different seasons of the year. In order to make it easier to understand the role of latitude in determining the levels of sunshine in the different U.S. cities, the data is averaged on a seasonal basis.



I tried having all four seasons represented on one grouped bar chart at first, but the graph ended up looking rather cluttered and noisy. The bars were too close together, and there were too many colors competing with one another. It made it difficult to commit attention to any single season. I revised the diagram to break the visualization down into four simple bar charts, one for each season. This enables the viewer more easily to compare the same season across cities without much cognitive burden. Bar charts were employed to best represent magnitude differences: one city gets many times more winter sun than another, etc.



Cities are arranged from south to north by latitude on each of the four graphs. Organizing them in this manner reinforces the geographic relationship I wish to highlight and makes it easier to understand from a latitude perspective because that is how people normally perceive it. The graph is laid out in a vertical manner in order to facilitate an top-to-bottom reading without having a very-wide graphic image. The graph is directly labeled with its season, thus skipping a legend. The use of colors reinforces a unified graphic image without diverting the observer’s attention.



In this approach, there are some trade offs. In breaking down the seasons into different charts, there is a slight drawback in comparing the different seasons for a given city through the graph because one would require scanning through different graphs. I settled for this drawback because the emphasis is placed on the way in which latitude contributes to the level of sunshine in every season, as opposed to having the emphasis placed on the variation in every city. The design is effective in conveying the relationship between latitude and levels of sunshine in major cities in the United States.
